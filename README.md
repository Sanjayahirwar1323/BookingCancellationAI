# 🏨 Hotel Reservation Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Hotel Reservation Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a hotel booking will be honored or canceled. The model analyzes various features such as customer details, booking history, and external factors to provide accurate predictions.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- 🤖 Machine learning model training and evaluation
- 🚀 Deployment-ready prediction pipeline

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** 🐍 Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Deployment (optional):** Flask, FastAPI

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about past hotel reservations, including:
- 📅 Booking status (confirmed/canceled)
- 👥 Customer demographics
- 🏨 Room preferences
- ⏳ Stay duration
- 🔄 Previous booking history

## 🚀 Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sanjayahirwar1323/hotelreservation-prediction.git
cd hotelreservation-prediction

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Usage
1. 📂 Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.
2. 🔄 Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. 🏋️ Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. 🔍 Run predictions on new data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv
   ```

## 📈 Results
The project evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected for deployment.
